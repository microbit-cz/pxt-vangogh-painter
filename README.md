This repository contains the source code for a MakeCode project that is intended to be uploaded to a Micro:bit board, which controls the [VanGogh painter](https://github.com/microbit-cz/Vangogh-painter) through the VanGogh Painter web application.

## About the Project

VanGogh Painter is a small vehicle that utilizes 3D printing, a Micro:bit microcomputer, and other components such as servos and stepper motors. The final product can draw using the [VanGogh library](https://github.com/microbit-cz/pxt-vangogh-extension).

## Installation

For proper functioning, it is necessary to upload this code to the Micro:bit board that is part of the VanGogh painter construction:

1. Connect the Micro:bit to your computer using a micro USB cable
2. Open the web environment [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org)
3. Import this project into MakeCode
4. Download the program to the Micro:bit

## Control

After uploading the code to the Micro:bit board, you can control the VanGogh painter through the VanGogh Painter web application, which is available at:

[https://github.com/microbit-cz/VanGogh-Painter-web](https://github.com/microbit-cz/VanGogh-Painter-web)

The web application allows you to send commands to the Micro:bit board, which then controls the movement of the vehicle and operates the pen for drawing.
